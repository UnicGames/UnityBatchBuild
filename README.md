# UnityBatchBuild

Batch build toolset for Unity, written in python

Just run 
```bash
./batch.py {action} {targets} {build mode} 
./batch.py [clean | build | archive | -c | -b | -a] [ios|android|wp8|360|xiaomi|...|all] [--debug | --release | -d | -r ]
```

Batch job to finish following boring work:
* Allow configure build targets to build several packages & platforms.
* Modify Unity macro & configuration
* Call Unity batch mode
* Modify xcode project settings, plist & resource
* Call Xcodebuild batch mode
* Pack the Xcode .app to .ipa
* Archive packages and streaming assets to remote host with SCP
* Run pre-configured shell script on local and remote host

Single command "./batch.py -c -b -a all" to do everything, and it can also be integrated with daily build.

# Dependency

* Mac OS (including: python, ssh)
* Unity
* Xcode
* mod-pbxproj

You need install mod-pbxproj before run build.py
```bash
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
$ sudo python get-pip.py
$ sudo pip install mod_pbxproj
```

Just git clone it to your UnityPorj/Assets/
